## OpenDF :: An open source implementation of DFramework.


### Let's use OpenDF instead of DFramework!

**In most cases, you can switch to OpenDF just by recompiling.**

Unfortunately, cases where OpenDF is not suitable:
* Use with special platform / CPU.
* Use unimplemented functions at the present.
* Open source software can not be adopted in your project.
